A form of magic it is, 
When the day ends and night begins, 
Tonight, 
You can focus on the fragile breeze
Transcending through your 
Weathered skin

Letting the bright guidance of stars, 
Serve as your light
And awareness within.

In this twilight hour,
You have the ability 
To slowly turn into yourself;

Celebrating that yesterday
Was somebody else.

Hand to heart, 
You can start
to awaken the flashes of strength, 
Allowing them to resurface
And turn into a warmth
That will never leave you.

As you gaze upon this dimly lit sky, 
To your surprise, 
You’ll find yourself in a place of peace, 
Enjoying the serenity within the silence
With no rush to say goodbye.

In this moment, 
The world has escaped from you

Instead of wondering,
How and why 
It’s passed by -

Follow this fear
And let it lift from your body.

Like the world, 
You are also 
Still finding a way
To keep spinning on your axis

Only you, 
Having the power to continue
The gravitational pull of your life.

This moment, 
This night, 
Will give you all the more reason to try. 

The sky is whispering, 
“You are here” 
While the light breeze 
Moves a mile a minute, 
Taking it with you. 

Along for the ride, 
You can soar through the trees, 
Making friends with their branches
And exhaling their leaves.

Let your breath find your body
As the night settles 
Into a soft blanket of stardust.

As the stars hold you tight, 
For it is not goodnight, 
But a figment of your dreams.

With grounding hope
And endless room, 
This is your chance to bloom. 

Use this space to create your own 
Colorful tones,
While relishing in the unspeakable 
Beauty of the unknown.


Accompanied by the full moon
Clear in sight, 
This is your chance
To free yourself of any unrest
And trust the guidance
Of your fate 
Serving as a friend and not a foe, 
To lead you into this settled moment.

You are now entering a prairie of emotions, 
With the moon sent as company
And the stars as serenity,
Serving as a reminder that your 
World can never truly go dark
While the sparks of night are your guide.

On this journey, 
You are capable of finding your truest self,
While feeling a new space in time 
For your curious mind.

As you breathe in the midnight air, 
You are welcoming a new home, 
Giving space for your dreams 
to create something you can see, touch, and feel. 

Humble for the past
While craving the future
This transformation will find you
And take you into a creative world unseen.

You have made it. 
This is your shelter, 
Your safe space
To become one
With the night 
and its whimsical delight.

Allow your beating heart 
to become its own work of art,
As you travel through the sky
While letting the soft words roll off 
Your supple tongue, 
Repeating to yourself
“I am alive”
